## Why Coversphere?

üîê Register and log into a secure portal

- Browse available insurance plans with category filters

- Purchase or subscribe to policies

- Use premium calculators to make informed decisions.

- File claims and track their progress

- View policy status (active, expired, pending) in real-time

2. Agent Dashboard
Optimized for insurance agents and advisors, enabling them to:
